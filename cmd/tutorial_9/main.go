/*
 * Goroutines are a way to lunch
 * multiple functions and have them executed concurently
 * Concurrency is not same as parallel execution
 * Concurrency means that having multiple tasks executing at the same time
 * One way of doing this is jumping back and forth from one task to another
 * In concurrent programming, while we wait for for example Database call,
 * CPU can move on to working on the other subtasks in the meantime
 *
 * But if we have 2 CPU Cores that are executing different tasks in parallel
 * Then the execution can happen simultaneously
 * The execution here is still concurrent because we have multiple tasks
 * executing at the same time but also these tasks are running in parallel
 * So this is true parallelysm
 *
 * In Go we have some level of parallelys as long as we have a multicore CPU

//// RWMutex Performance Benefits in This Code:
// 1. MAIN PURPOSE: Prevents log() from reading while save() is writing
// 2. PERFORMANCE BOOST: Multiple log()/read calls can run simultaneously
// 3. SAFETY: Prevents reading half-written results2 data
//
// Basically,
// RWMutex allows multiple "READERS" to access the shared resource simultaneously,
// while only one writer can access it at a time.
// This improves performance
// by allowing concurrent reads while still ensuring data consistency.
//
// Normal Mutex: log() calls would wait in line (slower)
// RWMutex: Multiple log() calls run together simultaneously (faster)
//
// Example with 5 goroutines calling log():
// - Normal Mutex: 5 Ã— 100ms = 500ms total (sequential)
// - RWMutex: 100ms total (parallel reading)
